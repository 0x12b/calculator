Cost Calculator Documentation
============
# Introduction

(https://costcalc.epfl.ch)

This documentation presents how to configure the cost calculator, it's not dedicated for final users but more for people that wants to update or change  providers or to develop new tools inside the cost calculator.

If you want to add/update a category or a provider you want to change **data.js**
The corresponding doc is here [data.js-config](data.js-config.md)

If you want to change something in the engine (or something not possible from **data.js**) See [configure.md](configure.md)

# INSTALL

You can use the cost calculator on your own webserver or use github pages.
If you use github pages you just need your own github repository 
and your cost calculator will be hosted by github (Use full if your IT service
 does'nt want you to have your own web space)

## Use your own webserver
It's pretty easy just copy the latest release into your a directory accessible from your webserver and it will work.

To personalize the tool  See [configure.md](configure.md).
