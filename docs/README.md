Cost Calculator Documentation
============
(https://rdmepfl.github.io/costcalc/)

This documentation presents how to configure the cost calculator, it's not dedicated for final user but more for people that wants to update or change the provider or to develop new tools inside the cost calculator.

If you want to add/update a category or a provider you want to change **data.js**
The corresponding doc is here [data.js-config](data.js-config.md)

If you want to change something in the engine (or something not possible from **data.js**) you might want to take to [configure.md](configure.md)
